1. Introduction
A small introduction on what the project aims to do, what problem it’s aiming to solve, the
motivation behind the project.
2. Dataset description
● Dataset Description
- How many features?
- Classification or regression problem? Why do you think so?
- How many data points?
- What kind of features are in your dataset? (Quantitative / Categorical)
- Do you need to encode the categorical variables, why or why not?
- Correlation of all the features (input and output features) (apply heatmap
using the seaborn library)
- What do you understand after the correlation test?

● Imbalanced Dataset
-For the output feature, do all unique classes have an equal number of instances
or not?
-Represent using a bar chart of N classes (N=number of classes you have in
your dataset).
● Perform exploratory data analysis to extract some important relationships from
your data. [Reference: EDA Lab CSE422 ]

3. Dataset pre-processing
● Faults
➔ Null / Missing values
➔ Categorical values
➔ Feature Scaling
● Solutions
➔ Delete rows/columns, Impute values [show cause]
➔ Encoding(as required) [show cause]
➔ Scaling as per requirement

Note: Firstly, discuss one problem, and then write about the solutions or pre-processing
techniques you have applied to solve that problem. Afterward, proceed to the next problem.

4. Dataset splitting
● Random/Stratified (as required)
● Train set (80% / 70%) (Use Validation Set as required)
● Test set (20% / 30%)
5. Model training & testing (Supervised)
● KNN (for classification problem)
● Decision Tree (for classification/regression problem)
● Logistic Regression (for classification problem)
● Linear Regression (for regression problem)
● Naive Bayes (for classification problem)
● Neural Network (for classification/regression problem) [This can be applied
using any library you feel comfortable with - sklearn, tensorflow, pytorch etc]
**** Treat the problem as an unsupervised learning problem, apply Kmeans and
showcase the clusters****

Remember you have to apply a Neural Network and at least 2 other models

6. Model selection/Comparison analysis
● Bar chart showcasing prediction accuracy of all models (for classification)
● Precision, recall comparison of each model. (for classification)
● Confusion Matrix (for classification)
● AUC score, ROC curve for each model (for classification)
● R2 score and Loss (for regression)
Compare the results of all models based on all of the above described metrics

7. Conclusion
- What do you understand from the results
- Make useful comments regarding the performance of your model
- Why do you think you are getting such results
- What are some of the challenges that you have faced
